# urbit-static-page

Basic template for mounting an arbitrary HTML page to an [Urbit](https://urbit.org) ship v.0.8.0 or higher.

## Overview

As of Urbit v0.8.0, the [eyre](https://urbit.org/docs/learn/arvo/eyre/) vane of Arvo no longer automatically mounts everything in the `/web` folder. It now works through the declaration of endpoints. This is a boilerplate for that.

### Future updates

- [ ] Commenting out examples of different file types
- [ ] Adding in examples of mapping multiple files of the same type to a single variable.
